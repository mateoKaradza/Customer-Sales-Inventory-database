# Customer-Sales-Inventory-database

This is a little tool I made for a business that I work(freelance) for.

How it works:

This tool/web app is using Node.js, Express, Jade as the View Engine and MySQL.

### Current Status & How It Works

The tool is working fine right now, although I'd like to put in on the web some day - how does it work then?
Well, the web server is being run locally at this moment since there is no authentication, it's not on my priority list at this moment, otherwise there would be a more secure version.

In case you'd like to try it out, everything is working, but you'd have to add one entry to the platforms table manually.
